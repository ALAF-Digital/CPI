              DUBAI, UAE, 3 May 2023: AMCA Middle East hosted the insite
              Technical Conference on May 3 at Le Méridien Dubai Hotel &
              Conference Centre. The event featured in-depth presentations from
              global HVAC personalities highlighting the importance of fresh air
              and why High-Performance Air Systems (HPAS) and certification are
              critical in ensuring future buildings are energy efficient and
              optimised to ensure the wellbeing of inhabitants and society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr Pawel Wargocki, Deputy Director and Associate Professor,
              International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, DTU Civil
              Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, provided the keynote
              address with a presentation, titled ‘What we know and should know
              about healthy buildings: Current evidence and future challenges’.
              The presentation demonstrated research on how Indoor Environmental
              Quality (IEQ) – including parameters defining the thermal,
              acoustic and luminous environment, as well as Indoor Air quality –
              impacts wellbeing, comfort, health, and work performance and
              learning. His presentation also underlined IEQ’s impact on sleep
              quality and the significant economic implications that incentivise
              the improvement of indoor conditions. Dr Wargocki further
              highlighted how buildings today are not adequately adapted to deal
              with the potential challenges of airborne transmission of
              infectious aerosols and overheating and how building resilience
              must become a design feature of any building, like fire-protection
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nerissa Deoraj, Senior Public Affairs Manager, Systemair Group,
              and one of the speakers at the event, highlighted the need to
              raise awareness on how ventilation and the air we breathe
              shouldn’t be taken for granted. “Ventilation and filtration play
              an essential role in providing healthy indoor environments,” she
              said. “We firmly believe it’s time to place efficient ventilation
              and IAQ at the forefront of sustainable HVAC.”
            </p>

            <p class="ccm_post_detail_txt_left">
              When it was her turn to speak, Deoraj provided an in-depth
              introduction to HPAS, demonstrating how modern variable air volume
              systems accommodate evolving needs for 100% fresh air, filtration,
              air treatment and variable airflow for commercial facilities.
              “Energy savings objectives cannot be allowed to result in less
              than acceptable IAQ,” Deoraj said. “These systems are called ‘high
              performance’, because they perform significantly better than
              systems that comply with the baseline requirements in building
              codes. HPAS design integrates right-sizing strategies, zone
              optimisation and outside-air-based free cooling. HPASs also
              minimise static pressure drop, system leakage and system effects.”

            <p>
              Providing a case study, Deoraj shared a cost comparison between
              HPAS and conventional air systems. Highlighting that while such
              systems might provide a 50% higher initial cost, the breakeven can
              be achieved within two years, and projects could see up to 40%
              savings in the course of 10 years. “These systems use advanced
              technologies, such as demand controls, EC motors or variable
              frequency drives, energy-recovery ventilation, and advanced
              filtration systems to reduce energy consumption and improve indoor
              air quality,” she said, adding that the critical benefits of HPASs
              include increased energy efficiency, reduced operating costs,
              improved IAQ and enhanced occupant comfort. “It’s important to
              remember that to achieve optimal performance, high-performance air
              systems require careful design and installation, as well as
              ongoing maintenance and monitoring,” she said.
            </p>

              Robb Clawson, Director of Marketing, Membership, and Education,
              AMCA International, concluded the conference by presenting how
              certification of product-performance ratings increases confidence
              that systems work as designed. Highlighting the cost associated
              with building and operating high-performing conditioned systems,
              Ivanovich highlighted how the ratings of products that manifest
              such meticulously designed systems should be independently
              verified in accordance with consensus-based test standards and
              rigorous certification processes. He further advocated that
              specifying certified products only increases engineers’ confidence
              that HVAC designs perform as intended.
